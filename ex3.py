# Prints out a statement
print('I will now count my chickens: ')

# NOTE: python uses PEMDAS (parenthesis, exponent, multiply, divide, add, subtract)
# Prints a statement and adds 25 plus 5
print('Hens', 25.0 + 30.0/6.0)
# Prints a statement and first divides 3 by 4, ,then takes the remainder and multiplies that by 25 then subtracts that all from 100
print('Roosters', 100-25 * 3 % 4)

# Prints a statement
print('Now I will count the eggs: ')

# Does the math using PEMDAS
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

# Prints a statement
print('Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7')
# Tests to see if left is smaller than right and returns a boolean
print(3 + 2 < 5-7)

# Prints a statement and adds 3 and 2
print('What is 3 + 2?', 3 + 2)
# prints a statement and subtracts 7 from 5
print('What is 5 - 7?', 5 - 7)

# Prints a statement
print("Oh! That's why it's False!")

# Prints yet another statement
print('How about some more.')

# Prints a statement and then determines who is greater and returns a boolean
print('Is it greater?', 5 > -2)
# Prints a statement, determines if bigger or equal, returns a boolean
print('Is it greater or equal?', 5 >= -2)
# Prints a statement, determines if smaller, returns a boolean
print('Is it less or equal?', 5<= -2)
